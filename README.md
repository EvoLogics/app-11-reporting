# APP-11(E) Report Scripts

This repository contains a python script that helps with the creation of APP-11(E) reports for the REPMUS 2023 exercise.

> [!WARNING]
> This script was created very quickly and with a very limited understanding of the APP-11(E) specification.
> It very likely contains some inaccuracies or bugs.
> It definitely contains some rather sketchy simplifications and quick workarounds.
> It is a good idea to check that the reports generated by the script are correct, and to make corrections where necessary.

> [!NOTE]
> This script was created for EvoLogics GmbH use.
> As such, it is tailored to the data formats we use internally, and it is probably not useful to external users in its current form.


## Setup

It is recommended to use python 3.6 or greater and to run the scripts in a virtual environment.
Using a virtual environment, you can install the required libraries with:
```bash
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```


## How it works

The script uses data contained in 2 files to generate the output (see `sample/` for an example):

- `parameters.ini`:<br>
   Contains general information about the reports you wish to generate (originator ID, message serial numbers, detection probabilities, etc...).
- `Mines.csv`:<br>
   Contains data about the mine detections during the survey.
   For now, this is generated externally.


## How to use

First, create the data directory in which the files that will be used to generate the report will be stored:
```bash
./create_directory.py <TASK_ELEMENT_ID> <AREA> <TASK_NUMBER> <DIRECTORY> --mines-file <MINES_FILE>
```
(run the script with `-h` to see more information).

Then, generate the reports:
```bash
./generate_reports.py -t <TASK_ELEMENT_ID> <AREA> <TASK_NUMBER> <DIRECTORY>
```
(run the script with `-h` to see more information).
